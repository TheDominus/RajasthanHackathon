# Project Title
Rajasthan Tourism App

## Problems
- Tourists visiting Rajasthan waste lots of time standing in queues for booking tickets of any tourist place because of the unavailability of a common booking platform.
- There is lack of adequate security and safety of tourists as well as their belongings.
- There is no proper review system of various tourist destinations as there is no platform for giving feedbacks.
- Visitors are sometimes unaware of special attractions/events happening at various tourist places which often results in less participation of tourists.

## Current Features
The Rajasthan Tourism App provides an online ticketing solution in which a user can book tickets for multiple tourist places in a common platform. A QR Code for each tourist destination place is generated for that user. The QR Code can be scanned at the destination and the user details are verified in a different Scanner App .

Two apps have been implemented:

- One for the ticket booking by users
- Another for the QR verification at the destination place

## Additional Features 
- Security and Safety:  Local Helpline numbers will be provided in the App. Tourists who are travelling together (family/friends) can create their own group in our App and their real-time location can be tracked by all members of that group via GPS.  For the security of the touristsâ€™ belongings, our App will contain a lost and found feature which will give notifications to tourists present at that moment about the lost item.
- Review System: Feedback forms will be provided in the App at the end of the day,  which will contain the ratings of various features such as cleanliness, food quality, security, overall experience and additional remarks for each tourist places visited. This feature will also inform the Rajasthan Government which areas to focus on.
- Awareness:  Our App will contain information about the special attractions and upcoming events at various tourists places which will encourage tourist participation and boost tourism in Rajasthan.
- Statistics: Daily visitor count of each tourist place will be recorded and the data will be analysed using Machine Learning. This will help in predicting monthly tourist count in future. Data from the feedback forms will be analysed and it will help in improving the standard of Rajasthan Tourism.
